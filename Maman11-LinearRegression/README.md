<h3>Results: </h3> 

Accuracy: 0.8573


The results of the algorithm are mostly consistent (~0.85 accuracy) in every run even though the test and example cases are selected randomly every time. These results are similar to the softmax and perceptron implementations.

This implementation runs faster than the others because it does not require iterations to achieve the high accuracy.
